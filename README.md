# dig_it
An upright game where you dig down and find treasure and figure out a way to get the hell back home. Currently Dig_It is being developed as a funtime retro-lofi project as a distraction from more important and scarier work.

# How to run it

[Get Love2d][love]. It's a lua-based game prototyping engine. Someday I will probably make actual builds for windows, mac, linux. If you want that, it doesn't hurt to say so.
